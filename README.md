# My Athletic-Inspired CV Site

Welcome to my Athletic-inspired CV website! ðŸŽ‰ This is a fun, creative project I built as part of my application to **The Athletic**. The website mimics the design and feel of **The Athletic** but serves as a personal portfolio and CV to showcase my skills, experience, and creativity in web development. The link to the site is included in the repository, but also
**[right here](https://theathletic.khir.ca)**.

## About the Project

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** A powerful React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for styling with ease and consistency.
- **[shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/):** A modern UI library for building beautiful, reusable components.

Thank you for checking out my project! If you're from **The Athletic**, I hope this project gives you insight into my creativity, technical expertise, and passion for delivering high-quality user experiences.

Cheers,  
**Hadi Khir**
